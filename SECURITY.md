# üîí Fluffy Python Security Policy

While this repository is primarily for educational purposes and is not a production-level application, we take security seriously and appreciate the community's help in keeping it safe.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please **do not** open a public issue. We ask that you report it to us directly.

You can submit a report by [creating a new security advisory](https://github.com/woliul/fluffy-python/security/advisories/new). This is the preferred method as it keeps the vulnerability details private while we work on a fix.

Please include the following details in your report:
* A brief description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The affected files and code lines.
* Your contact information so we can follow up with you.

### üõ°Ô∏è What Happens After You Report a Vulnerability?

1.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
2.  We will investigate the issue and determine its impact.
3.  Once the vulnerability is patched, we will create a public advisory to inform the community and credit you for your responsible disclosure (if you wish to be credited).

Thank you for helping us keep **Fluffy Python** safe and secure for everyone.
