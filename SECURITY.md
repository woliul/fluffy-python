# üÜò Fluffy Python Support Guide

Welcome to the Fluffy Python community! We're here to help you on your Python learning journey. If you run into any issues, have questions about the code, or need general assistance, here's how you can get help.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs and Code Issues

If you find a bug in the code or a mistake in the explanations, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/woliul/fluffy-python/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

When reporting an issue, please include:
* A clear and descriptive title.
* A brief summary of the problem.
* Steps to reproduce the bug.
* The expected behavior versus the actual behavior.
* Your operating system and Python version.

### ‚ùì Asking Questions and Seeking Help

If you have a question about a specific code snippet, a Python concept, or need help with your own code, we encourage you to use the GitHub Discussions feature (if enabled) or open a new issue.

To ask a question:
1.  Check the existing issues and discussions to see if your question has already been answered.
2.  If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/woliul/fluffy-python/issues/new/choose) with a title like "Question: [Your question summary here]".
3.  Provide as much detail as possible, including a code snippet if relevant.
