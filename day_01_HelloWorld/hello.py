# Day 1: The print() Function

# This function is used to display output to the console.
# It's your program's way of "talking" to the user!

# 1. Printing a simple text (string)
print("Hello, LinkedIn!")
print("Python is fun!")

# 2. Printing numbers (integers and floats)
print(123)
print(3.14159)

# 3. Printing the result of a mathematical operation
print(5 + 3) # This will print 8
print(10 / 2) # This will print 5.0

# 4. Printing multiple items, separated by a comma (adds a space by default)
print("My name is", "Woliul")

# 5. Using the 'end' parameter to change what comes at the end (default is a newline)
print("This is on the same line", end=" ")
print("as the previous text.")
