# Day 1: The print() Function

# This function is used to display output to the console.
# It's your program's way of "talking" to the user!

print("Hello, LinkedIn!")
print("Python is fun!")

# You can also print numbers directly
print(123)

# Or even the result of a simple calculation
print(5 + 3)
