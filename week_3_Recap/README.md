# Week 3: Recap & Review üìù

Congratulations on completing another week of your Python journey! Week 3 was a major milestone, introducing core programming paradigms and real-world tools that will be the foundation for everything you build from here.

### Key Concepts Covered

* **Dictionaries:** We learned how to store data in key-value pairs, a crucial skill for working with structured data like JSON.
* **Error Handling:** We mastered the use of `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to write more robust and professional code that gracefully handles unexpected issues.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** We introduced the power of classes, objects, and inheritance to create reusable, scalable, and organized code.
* **APIs:** We connected our programs to the internet using the `requests` library, a vital skill for fetching data from external services.

### üí° Practice & Mini-Project

This week's challenge is to combine everything you've learned. Build a mini-project that:

1.  **Uses a `class`** to model a real-world object (e.g., `Book`, `Movie`, or `Product`).
2.  **Fetches data from a public API** (like the Open Library API for books or the OMDB API for movies) using `requests`.
3.  **Parses the JSON response** from the API and uses a `dictionary` to store the data.
4.  **Creates an `object`** from your class using the dictionary data.
5.  **Includes `try...except`** blocks to handle potential API request errors or invalid data.

### ‚û°Ô∏è What's Next?

We're moving into **Intermediate Python** in Week 4! We'll start by exploring more data structures, including **Tuples** and **Sets**, and dive deeper into powerful, one-line code constructs like Lambda Functions. Get ready to expand your Python toolkit.
