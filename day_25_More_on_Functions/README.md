# Day 25: More on Functions: *args & **kwargs ‚öôÔ∏è

Welcome to another advanced functions lesson! Today, you'll learn to write functions that can handle a variable number of arguments, a technique that makes your code highly flexible and reusable. We'll focus on `*args` and `**kwargs`.

### Key Concepts

#### `*args` (Arbitrary Positional Arguments)
The `*args` syntax allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of **non-keyword** arguments. The star `*` unpacks the arguments passed to the function, and they are collected into a **tuple** named `args` inside the function.


**Analogy:** Imagine a function that takes an order. If you're not sure how many items the customer will order, you can use `*args` to handle any number of items.

#### `**kwargs` (Arbitrary Keyword Arguments)
The `**kwargs` syntax allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of **keyword** arguments. The double-star `**` unpacks the arguments, and they are collected into a **dictionary** named `kwargs` inside the function.

**Analogy:** Continuing the restaurant analogy, if you're not sure what special requests a customer might have (e.g., `extra_cheese=True`, `no_onions=False`), you can use `**kwargs` to handle all of them.

### üìù Practice Exercises

1.  **Average Calculator:** Write a function `calculate_average(*scores)` that takes a variable number of scores and returns their average.
2.  **User Profile Printer:** Create a function `print_profile(**details)` that takes a user's name and any other keyword arguments (e.g., `country`, `job`) and prints them in a formatted way.
3.  **Flexible Printer:** Write a single function that accepts a required argument, an arbitrary number of positional arguments, and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, then prints them all out clearly.

### ‚ú® Best Practices & Professional Notes

* **Clarity over Conciseness:** While `*args` and `**kwargs` are powerful, don't overuse them if the number of arguments is fixed. Explicit, named parameters are often clearer.
* **The Order Matters:** When a function has all three types of arguments, the order is always: `def func(regular_args, *args, **kwargs):`.
* **The Names are Convention:** The names `args` and `kwargs` are conventions, not requirements. You could use `*params` or `**options`, but sticking to the convention makes your code more readable for other Python developers.

### üèÉ How to Run This Code

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the `day_25_More_on_Functions` directory.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/fluffy-python/day_25_More_on_Functions
    ```
3.  Run the script using:
    ```bash
    python args_kwargs_intro.py
    ```
