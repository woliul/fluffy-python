# Week 4: Recap & Review üéâ

Congratulations on completing four full weeks of your Python journey! This week was a huge leap forward, transitioning from core fundamentals to intermediate concepts that truly set your code apart.

### Key Concepts Covered

* **Tuples & Sets:** We learned to choose the right tool for the job. Tuples for unchangeable, ordered data, and Sets for unordered, unique data.
* **Strings & Regular Expressions:** We became masters of text manipulation, using both built-in string methods and the powerful `re` module for pattern matching.
* **Lambda Functions & List Comprehensions:** We adopted "Pythonic" one-liners to make our code more concise, readable, and efficient.
* ***args & \*\*kwargs:** We learned to write incredibly flexible functions that can accept a variable number of arguments.
* **Project: Simple Web Scraper:** We put our skills to the test, building a practical tool that fetches, parses, and extracts data from the web.
* **Working with CSV & JSON:** We learned to handle the most common data exchange formats, bridging the gap between our scripts and external data sources.

### üí° Mini-Project & Challenge

For this week's challenge, let's combine all of our new skills.

**Challenge:** Write a script that scrapes all the links (`href` attributes) from a web page. Use a **Set** to ensure you only collect unique links. Then, organize this data into a structured format (a **list of dictionaries**) and save it to a **JSON file**. Use a `try...except` block for robust error handling.

### ‚û°Ô∏è What's Next?

Get ready for an exciting new phase! We're diving into the world of **Data Analysis** in Week 5, starting with powerful libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`. This will be the start of a major specialization in your journey to becoming a data-proficient developer.
