# Day 2: Variables - Storing Information

# Variables are like labeled boxes where you can store different types of data.
# You give the box a name, and then you put something inside it.

# 1. Storing a String (text)
user_name = "Woliul"
greeting = 'Hello, Python Learner!'
print("User Name:", user_name)
print("Greeting:", greeting)

# 2. Storing an Integer (whole number)
age = 30
number_of_lessons = 2
print("Age:", age)
print("Lessons completed:", number_of_lessons)

# 3. Storing a Float (decimal number)
price = 19.99
pi_value = 3.14159
print("Product Price:", price)
print("Value of Pi:", pi_value)

# 4. Storing a Boolean (True/False value)
is_learning_python = True
has_finished_course = False
print("Is learning Python?", is_learning_python)
print("Has finished course?", has_finished_course)

# You can also change the value of a variable
current_mood = "Happy"
print("Current mood (before change):", current_mood)
current_mood = "Excited about Python!"
print("Current mood (after change):", current_mood)

# Variables can be used in calculations
total_cost = price * number_of_lessons
print("Total cost of lessons:", total_cost)
