## Daily Structure 🗺️

Here is the complete structure used for each daily post, including all the components.

### 1. GitHub `README.md` Content
This is the documentation for the day's code, designed for the GitHub repository. It includes:
* A markdown heading with the day and topic (e.g., `# Day 20: Working with APIs`).
* A brief introduction to the day's concept.
* A **Key Concepts** section that explains the core ideas with analogies.
* A **Practice Exercises** section with 2-3 new challenges.
* A **Best Practices & Professional Notes** section with tips for real-world application.
* A **How to Run This Code** section with simple command-line instructions.
* A link back to the main repository `README.md`.

### 2. Code Preparation
This section provides a complete, runnable Python script for the day's topic. It includes:
* A clear filename (e.g., `day_XX_topic.py`).
* The code itself, with comments explaining each key line or concept.
* Instructions for any necessary `pip install` commands.

### 3. LinkedIn Post Content
This is the plain text for a social media post. It includes:
* A main heading with the Week Number, day and topic (e.g., Week 4, Day 23! #PythonAPIs).
* A brief, engaging hook about the day's topic.
* A simple explanation of the concept's value.
* A call to action with a link to the GitHub folder.
* Relevant hashtags. (Mixed with default hashtags & topic-based)
  * This are default hastags: #python #learntocode #programmingjourney #dailycoding #learnwitholi
  * Also add topic-based hashtags if possible (e.g. #regex #textprocessing).

### 4. LinkedIn Slide Content
This is the outline for a visual carousel, presented in a simple, easy-to-read format. It includes:
* **Slide 1:** A main title (e.g., "Working with APIs 🌐").
* **Slide 2:** A brief explanation of the topic. (e.g., "What are APIs 🌐: APIs is ...").
* **Slide 3 & 4:** Short, punchy explanations of core concepts with simple code or syntax examples.
* **Final Slide:** A call to action.

### Weekly Recap Structure

For the weekly recap, the structure is slightly different and requires three distinct parts:

1.  **GitHub `README.md` Content:** A brief summary of the week for the repository.
2.  **Weekly Article for LinkedIn Newsletter:** A comprehensive markdown article following a specific format:
    * A primary heading. (e.g., "Python Journey: ¡Hasta la vista, Week 3!" or "Python Journey: 30 Days of Python").
    * An introduction.
    * Subheadings for each major topic of the week.
    * Each topic section includes Topic details, explanation, an analogy and a code snippet.
    * A "The Full Circle" section that ties all the concepts together.
    * A "What's Next?" section.
    * A concluding paragraph with a link to the GitHub repository. (e.g., 
        ````markdown
